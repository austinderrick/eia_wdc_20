U.S. Energy Information Administration Web Data Connector

Have you ever needed an easy source of coal usage data over time? Maybe your project calls for electricity consumption or petroleum prices. Luckily, the U.S. Energy Information Administration has all of the energy metrics you could imagine!

Collecting this data isn’t terribly complicated, but it can be time consuming if you need more than one or two metrics. With the power of Tableau’s Web Data Connector system, we built a platform to bridge the gap and make importing the EIA's data into Tableau extremely easy!

To get the energy data you need, simply connect to a new data source in any version of Tableau greater than 9.1. Under To a server, choose Web Data Connector as the source. 

In the URL box, type http://wdc.poc.interworks.com/. On this page, select the WDC system you’d like to use; in this case, U.S. Energy Information Administration.

From here, you can drill down by category to find the metrics you would like to use. Once you have selected all of the metrics you want, simply click Get Data to pull the data into Tableau.
